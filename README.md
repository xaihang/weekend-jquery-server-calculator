# Calculator - server side 

## Description

This application allows users to input numbers and choose a mathematical operation. Upon clicking the submit (`=`) button, the calculation is performed on the server-side via a POST request, and the result can be retrieved using a GET request. The Clear button erases both user inputs and displayed results. The application also keeps a record of all previous calculations on the server and displays a list of them when the page loads using a GET request. The history log updates dynamically with each new calculation and remains accessible even after refreshing the page.
